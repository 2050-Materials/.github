# 2050 Materials
üíæ üèóÔ∏è Welcome to the official GitHub repository for 2050 Materials, the data-driven backbone of sustainable construction. Here, we leverage AI-powered algorithms alongside meticulous LCA calculations to curate the most extensive, high-quality database of climate data concerning building materials.

## Our Mission

At [2050 Materials](https://2050-materials.com/sustainability-data-api/), we aim to seamlessly integrate sustainability data into the digital design process. We enable architects, designers, and engineers to make real-time embodied impact calculations, thereby fostering sustainable practices in construction from the ground up.

## Features

- **API-First Approach:** Our systems are built to integrate with a variety of platforms, ensuring that sustainability data is accessible where and when you need it.
- **Real-Time Calculations:** Instantaneous embodied impact calculations allow for agile decision-making in the design process.
- **Extensive Database:** Access a comprehensive collection of data regarding the climate impact of various building materials.
